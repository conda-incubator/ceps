## Abstract

`menuinst` is a library used by `conda` to install menu items that point to commands provided by
`conda` packages. It operates by discovering certain JSON files located in `$PREFIX/Menu` after
linking the package to the environment.

This library has supported Windows for a long time but support for Linux and MacOS was not there
(even if the original project did offer support). As these platforms are brought up to speed, we
have an opportunity to fix some existing issues with the project and its integations. Namely:

1. Providing the same Python API for all platforms
2. Consolidating the `conda-standalone` / `constructor` CLI integrations in `conda` itself
3. Consolidating the JSON metadata required in each OS and formalize it in a schema so other
   implementations can validate it with automated tooling.


## Python API

### Current state

`menuinst` provides a Python API comprised of a single function `menuinst.install(...)`
with the following signature:

```python
def install(path, remove=False, prefix=sys.prefix, recursing=False, root_prefix=sys.prefix):
  ...
```

> Note that calling `menuinst.install` for platforms other than Windows currently fails due to the
extra `root_prefix` argument added for `conda-standalone` compatibility.

Other projects provide a layer on top of `menuinst.install`:

* `constructor/nsis/_nsis.py` [introduces](https://github.com/conda/constructor/blob/master/constructor/nsis/_nsis.py#L107)
  `mk_menus` and `rm_menus`, which iterate `PREFIX/Menu` looking for suitable JSON files.

```python
def mk_menus(remove=False, prefix=None, pkg_names=None, root_prefix=None):
    ...

def rm_menus(prefix=None, root_prefix=None):
    ...
```

* `conda` [provides](https://github.com/conda/conda/blob/33a142c16530fcdada6c377486f1c1a385738a96/conda/gateways/disk/create.py#L231-L248)
 `make_menu`, which actively excludes Linux / MacOS.

```python
def make_menu(prefix, file_path, remove=False):
    ...
```

### Motivation

The official API is confusing (install can also remove) and leaves opportunity for downstream to
create their own logic for basic functionality. `menuinst` should be the sole provider here.


### Suggested actions

`menuinst` needs to provide two functions: `install` and `remove`.

```python
def install(metadata: [str, dict], target_prefix: str = sys.prefix, root_prefix: str = sys.prefix) -> List[str]:
  ...

def remove(metadata: [str, dict], target_prefix: str = sys.prefix, root_prefix: str = sys.prefix) -> List[str]:
  ...
```

`metadata` can be either a path to a JSON file, a file handler or an already parsed object.
Regardless the source, the resulting metadata object needs to satisfy the metadata schema.
Both functions return a list of strings that point to the path of the menu items created or removed.

Additionally, an utility function for prefixes could provide:

```python
def install_all(prefix: str, root_prefix: str = sys.prefix, filter: callable = None) -> List[List[str]]:
  ...

def remove_all(prefix: str, root_prefix: str = sys.prefix, filter: callable = None) -> List[List[str]]:
  ...
```

It should be discussed whether:

* `root_prefix` is only used internally by `conda-standalone` / `constructor` and hence should be
  made a private name `_root_prefix`.
* `recursing` is needed on Windows or not.

### Backwards compatibility

New `conda` releases will pin accordingly. Releasing this API would entail a new major version, which
should be enough to prevent breakages. Current version `4.10.3` is [pinning](https://github.com/conda-forge/conda-feedstock/blob/master/recipe/meta.yaml#L46)
`menuinst` as `>=1.4.11,<2`.


## CLI API

### Current state

`menuinst` does provide a CLI through [`menuinst.main`](https://github.com/conda/menuinst/blob/9ae6c95/menuinst/main.py):

```console
$> menuinst [--remove] [--prefix=sys.prefix] [json_file json_file ...]
```

However, `constructor` needs a way to call it from `conda-standalone`, which prompted this project
to provide a [custom entry point](https://github.com/conda-forge/conda-standalone-feedstock/blob/834590a/recipe/entry_point.py#L25-L88)
that mimics a `conda` sub-command:

```console
$> conda-standalone constructor [--prefix] [--make-menus|--rm-menus] ...
```
> This is needed because, even with `menuinst` own CLI, `conda-standalone` is a `pyinstaller`-frozen
> executable which cannot call arbitrary entry points in the bundle.

### Motivation

A standard `menuinst` CLI (standalone or through conda) is needed and must not be provided as part
of the `conda-standalone` project only. It is a surprising behaviour that needs to be replicated
by other implementations and, as such, should be part of the main codebase.

> `constructor` allows a different standalone conda executable to be bundled through the `--conda-exe`
option, which opens the possibility of using `micromamba` as the bundled conda. The `constructor`
sub-command is expected though, so `micromamba` needs to provide it as well.

### Suggested actions

Provide a `conda constructor` subcommand, officially part of the `conda` core. It should implement
the same CLI as currently found in the `constructor` entry point, delegating the menu creation
and removal to the `menuinst` public API. This CLI should be standardized so other projects can
implement it if needed.

`menuinst` itself does not need to provide a CLI, but if it does, it should be as similar as possible
to the `constructor` counterparts.


## Menu metadata schema

## Motivation

* Discuss currently accepted schemas across platforms
* Placeholders
* Inconsistent key names
* Opportunities for simplification

## Backwards compatibility

* Windows users do depend on the existing schema. There are a lot of packages that use it. This (unversioned) document needs to be kept around and respected.
