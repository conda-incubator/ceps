## Abstract

Have conda channels serve standalone `run_exports` metadata, next to `repodata.json`.

## Motivation

Building infrastructure (such as some conda-forge bots) use `run_exports` to calculate which packages need rebuilding as part of an upgrade. Right now, conda-forge needs to maintain their own JSON database, which involves downloading and extracting the new artifacts as they become available: the `run_exports` metadata lives inside the `.tar.bz2` and `.conda` files.

Since `conda-index` already processes the package metadata to generate `repodata.json`, it would be trivial to also generate `run_exports.json` and serve it next to it.

## Specification

The schema of `run_exports.json` would mimic the `repodata.json` structure whenever possible:

* `info`: metadata about the platform, architecture, and version of the `run_exports.json` schema.
* `packages`: map of `.tar.bz2` filenames to `run_exports` metadata `dict`.
* `packages.conda`: map of `.conda` filenames to `run_exports` metadata `dict`.

Each `run_exports` metadata `dict` can contain the following fields; each field accepts a list of strings (conda-build specs).

- `weak`
- `strong`
- `weak_constrains`
- `strong_constrains`
- `noarch`

```json
{   
    "info": {
        "platform": "string",
        "arch": "string",
        "subdir": "string",
        "version": 0
    },
    "packages": {
        "package-version-build.tar.bz2": {
            "run_exports": {
                "noarch": [
                    "string",
                ],
                "strong": [
                    "string",
                ],
                "strong_constrains": [
                    "string",
                ],
                "weak": [
                    "string",
                ],
                "weak_constrains": [
                    "string",
                ],
            }
        }
    },
    "packages.conda": {
        "package-version-build.conda": {
            "run_exports": {
                "noarch": [
                    "string",
                ],
                "strong": [
                    "string",
                ],
                "strong_constrains": [
                    "string",
                ],
                "weak": [
                    "string",
                ],
                "weak_constrains": [
                    "string",
                ],
            }
        }
    }
}
```

## Backwards compatibility

This is a new feature, so there is no backwards compatibility to worry about.

## Alternatives

We could maintain the status quo and ask downstream infrastructure to maintain their own database. However, this is a burden on them, and it is trivial to generate this data.

We also considered _adding_ the `run_exports` metadata to `repodata.json`, but this has a few shortcomings:

- It would require extending the `repodata` schema, currently not formally standardized.
- It would increase the size of the already heavy `repodata.json` files.
- (Typed) repodata parsers would need to be updated to handle the new field.

Finally, we studied whether the `run_exports` metadata already present in the `channeldata.json` metadata would be enough. However, this metadata is only presented per version (not build), so it is insufficient and incomplete.

## FAQ

### Which packages should be included?

`run_exports` metadata is optional and not all packages have it. Should we only list artifacts that define it? Or should we list all artifacts, and have an empty `run_exports` field for those that don't define it?

### Will this affect the performance of repodata fetching?

Only package building infrastructure (such as conda-forge bots) will need to fetch this data. The rest of the ecosystem (such as CLI conda clients) will not be affected.
