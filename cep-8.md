## Abstract

In order to promote transparency and certainty about how long a specific version of conda will be
supported, this CEP will introduce an official policy spelling this out. Using 
statistics collected about current conda usage, this CEP will also help the community figure out where
we currently want to draw the line on version support.

## Specification

This section will contain the exact details of our conda version support windows.

## Motivation

The motivation for writing this CEP is first and foremost making the agreement between the 
development team and conda users clear. We do not want anyone having to guess whether 
the version of conda they use is still supported. Furthermore, this set of expectations
will also make the job of developing and supporting conda easier.

## Rationale

This section will hold the reasons why we settled on a particular support window for conda
versions.

## Backwards Compatibility

Highlight backwards compatibility issues here.

## Alternatives

- Indefinitely support all conda versions ever: not at all sustainable or practical for the development team.


## FAQ

Please put questions that may come up in this section.

## Resolution

This section contains the final decision on this issue.

## Reference

Please put any reference material here.
