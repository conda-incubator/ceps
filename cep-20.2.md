## Abstract

We propose a new recipe format that is heavily inspired by conda-build. The main
change is a pure YAML format without arbitrary Jinja or comments with semantic
meaning.

## Motivation

The conda-build format is currently under-specified. For the new format, we try to list all values
and types in a single document and document them. This is part of a larger effort (see [CEP-13](/cep-13.md) for the new YAML syntax).

## History

A discussion was started on what a new recipe spec could or should look like.
The fragments of this discussion can be found here:
https://github.com/mamba-org/conda-specs/blob/master/proposed_specs/recipe.md
The reason for a new spec are:

- Make it easier to parse ("pure yaml"). conda-build uses a mix of comments and
  jinja to achieve a great deal of flexibility, but it's hard to parse the
  recipe with a computer
- iron out some inconsistencies around multiple outputs (build vs. build/script
  and more)
- remove any need for recursive parsing & solving
- cater to needs for automation and dependency tree analysis via a determinstic
  format

## Major differences with conda-build

Outputs and top-level package are mutually exclusive, and outputs have exactly the same structure as top-level keys.
If outputs exist, the top-level keys are 'merged' with the output keys (e.g. for the about section).

# Format

## Schema version

The implicit version of the YAML schema for a recipe is an integer 1. 
To discern between the "old" format and the new format, we utilize the file name.
The old format is `meta.yaml` and the new format is `recipe.yaml`.
The version can be explicitly set by adding a `schema_version` key to the recipe.

```yaml
# optional, since implicitly defaults to 1
schema_version: 1  # integer
```

To benefit from autocompletion, and other LSP features in editors, we can add a schema URL to the recipe.

```yaml
# yaml-language-server: $schema=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/prefix-dev/recipe-format/main/schema.json
```

## Context section

```yaml
# The context dictionary defines arbitrary key-value pairs for Jinja interpolation
# and replaces the {% set ... %} commands commonly used in recipes
context:
  variable: test
  # note that we can reference previous values, that means that they are rendered in order
  other_variable: test_${{ variable }}
```

## Package section

```yaml
package:
  # The name of the package
  name: string
  # The version of the package, following the conda version spec
  # Note that versions are always strings (1.23 is _not_ a valid version since it is a `float`. Needs to be quoted.)
  version: string
```

## Build section

```yaml
build:
  # the build number
  number: Option<integer>, defaults to 0

  # the build string. This is usually ommited (can use `${{ hash }}` variable here)
  string: Option<string>, defaults to a build string made from "package hash & build number"

  # A list of conditions under which to skip the build of this package (they are joined by `or`)
  skip: [list of expressions]

  # wether the package is a noarch package, and if yes, wether it is "generic" or "python"
  noarch: Option<"generic" | "python">

### Script env dictionary

Where the `ScriptEnv` section is defined as follows:

```yaml
# list of environment variables to pass through to the script environment
# these are saved in the package / rendered recipe
passthrough: [string]
# A map of environment variables to set in the script environment
env: {string: string}
# A list of environment variables to leak into the build environment but keep "secret"
# meaning they will not be embedded into the final package and will not be printed to stdout
secrets: [string]
```

## Source section

```yaml
source: [SourceElement]
```

where the different source elements are defined as follows.

### URL source

```yaml
# url pointing to the source tar.gz|zip|tar.bz2|...
url: url
# destination folder in work directory
target_directory: path
# hash of the file
sha256: hex string
# legacy md5 sum of the file
md5: hex string
# relative path from recipe file
patches: [path]
# Rename the file to the given name.
# Prevents the file from being extracted if it is an archive.
file_name: string
```

### Local source

```yaml
# file, absolute or relative to recipe file
path: path
# destination folder
target_directory: path
# Rename the file to the given name.
# Prevents the file from being extracted if it is an archive.
file_name: string
# absolute or relative path from recipe file
patches: [path]
```

### Git source

```yaml
# URL to the git repository or path to local git repository
git_url: url | path
# revision to checkout to (commit or tag)
git_rev: string
# depth of the git clone (mutually exclusive with git_rev)
git_depth: signed integer (defaults to -1 -> not shallow)
```

### Removed source definitions

SVN and HG (mercury) source definitions are removed as they are not relevant anymore.

## Requirements section

```yaml
requirements:
  # build time dependencies, in the build_platform architecture
  build: [MatchSpec]
  # dependencies to link against, in the target_platform architecture
  host: [MatchSpec]
  # the section below is copied into the index.json and required at package installation
  run: [MatchSpec]
  # constrain optional packages
  run_constrained: [MatchSpec]
```

### Test section

<details>
<summary>
The current state of the Test section which is being removed with this spec.

Note: the test section also has a weird implicit behavior with `run_test.sh`, `run_test.bat` as well as `run_test.py` and `run_test.pl` script files
that are run as part of the test.

</summary>
The current YAML format for the test section is:

```yaml
test:
  # files (from recipe directory) to include with the tests
  files: [glob]
  # files (from the work directory) to include with the tests
  source_files: [glob]
  # requirements at test time, in the target_platform architecture
  requires: [MatchSpec]
  # commands to execute
  commands: [string]
  # imports to execute with python (e.g. `import <string>`)
  imports: [string]
  # downstream packages that should be tested against this package
  downstreams: [MatchSpec]
```

</details>

The new test section consists of a list of test elements. Each element is executed independently and can have different requirements. There are multiple types of test elements defined, such as the `command` test element, the `python` test element and the `downstream` test element.

```yaml
test: [TestElement]
```

#### Command test element

```yaml
# script to execute
script: string | [string]
# optional extra requirements
extra_requirements:
  # extra requirements with build_platform architecture (emulators, ...)
  build: [MatchSpec]
  # extra run dependencies
  run: [MatchSpec]
# extra files to add to the package for the test
# Alternatively, use ${{ RECIPE_DIR }} or ${{ SOURCE_DIR }} and a single list?
# or $RECIPE_DIR / $SRC_DIR ...
files:
  # files from $SRC_DIR
  source: [glob]
  # files from $RECIPE_DIR
  recipe: [glob]
```

#### Python test element

```yaml
python:
  # list of imports to try
  imports: [string]
```

#### Downstream test element

```yaml
downstream: MatchSpec
```

## Outputs section

conda-build has very hard to understand behavior with multiple outputs. We propose some drastic simplifications.
Each output in the new format has the same keys as a "top-level" recipe.

Values from the top-level `build`, `source` and `about` sections are (deeply) merged into each of the outputs.

The top-level package field is replaced by a top-level `recipe` field. The `version` from the top-level
`recipe` is also merged into each output. The top-level name is ignored (but could be used, e.g. for
the feedstock-name in the conda-forge case).

```yaml
# note: instead of `package`, it says `recipe` here
recipe:
  name: string # mostly ignored, could be used for feedstock name
  version: string # merged into each output if not overwritten by output

outputs:
  - package:
      name: string
      version: string (defaults to top-level version)
    build:
      script: ...
    requirements:
      # same definition as top level

    # as top level, by default merged from outer recipe
    about:
    source:
    test:
```

Before the build, the outputs are topologically sorted by their dependencies. Each output acts as an independent recipe.

> **Note**
> A previous version contained a idea for a "cache-only" output. We've moved that to a future CEP.

### Aside: variant computation for multiple outputs

Multiple outputs are treated like individual recipes after the merging of the nodes is completed.
Therefore, each variant is computed for each output individually.

Another tricky bit is that packages can be "strongly" connected with a `pin_subpackage(name, exact=True)` constraint.
In this case, the pinned package should also be part of the "variant configuration" for the output and appropriately zipped.

For example, we can have three outputs: `libmamba`, `libmambapy`, and `mamba`.

- `libmamba` -> creates a single variant as it is a low-level C++ library
- `libmambapy` -> creates multiple packages, one per python version
- `mamba` -> creates multiple packages (one per python + libmambapy version)

This has historically been an issue in conda-build, as it didn't take into account `pin_subpackage` edges as "variants" and
sometimes created the same hashes for two different outputs. E.g. in the following situation, conda-build would only create a single
`foofoo` package (instead of two variants that exactly pin two different libfoo packages):
