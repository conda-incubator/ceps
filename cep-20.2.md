## Abstract

We propose a new recipe format that is heavily inspired by conda-build. The main
change is a pure YAML format without arbitrary Jinja or comments with semantic
meaning.

## Motivation

The conda-build format is currently under-specified. For the new format, we try to list all values
and types in a single document and document them. This is part of a larger effort (see [](/cep-20.1.md) for the new YAML syntax).

## History

A discussion was started on what a new recipe spec could or should look like.
The fragments of this discussion can be found here:
https://github.com/mamba-org/conda-specs/blob/master/proposed_specs/recipe.md
The reason for a new spec are:

- Make it easier to parse ("pure yaml"). conda-build uses a mix of comments and
  jinja to achieve a great deal of flexibility, but it's hard to parse the
  recipe with a computer
- iron out some inconsistencies around multiple outputs (build vs. build/script
  and more)
- remove any need for recursive parsing & solving
- cater to needs for automation and dependency tree analysis via a determinstic
  format

## Major differences with conda-build

Outputs and top-level package are mutually exclusive, and outputs have exactly the same structure as top-level keys.
If outputs exist, the top-level keys are 'merged' with the output keys (e.g. for the about section).

# Format

## Context section

```yaml
# The context dictionary defines arbitrary key-value pairs for Jinja interpolation
# and replaces the {% set ... %} commands commonly used in recipes
context:
  variable: test
  # note that we can reference previous values
  other_variable: test_${{ variable }}
```

## Package section

```yaml
package:
  # The name of the package
  name: string
  # The version of the package, following the conda version spec
  # Note that versions are always strings (1.23 is _not_ a valid version since it is a `float`. Needs to be quoted.)
  version: string
```

## Build section

```yaml
build:
    # the build number
    number: Option<integer>, defaults to 0
    # the build string. This is usually ommited
    string: Option<string>, defaults to a build string made from "package hash & build number"

    # if it is only one element and ends with `.sh` or `.bat`
    script: string | [string]

    # Wether to include the recipe or not in the final package
    include_recipe: bool (defaults to true)

    # environment variables to either pass through to the script environment or set
    script_env: [env_vars]

    # A run export adds a dependency to the run requirements of a package if listed in build or host dependencies
    run_exports: [MatchSpec] OR {strong: [MatchSpec], weak: [MatchSpec], strong_constrains: [MatchSpec], weak_constrains: [MatchSpec], noarch: [MatchSpec]}

    # Allow linking against libraries that are not in the run requirements

    # overlinking_ignore_patterns: [glob]

    # defaults to patchelf (only cudatoolkit is using `lief` for some reason)
    # rpaths_patcher: None
```

## Source section

```yaml
source: [SourceElement]
```

where the different source elements are defined as follows.

### URL source

```yaml
# url pointing to the source tar.gz|zip|tar.bz2|...
url: url
# destination folder in work directory
folder: path
# hash of the file
sha256: hex string
# absolute or relative path from recipe file
patches: [path]
# removed keys
# fn: string
# md5: hex string
# sha1: hex string
```

### Local source

```yaml
# file, absolute or relative to recipe file
path: path
# destination folder
folder: path
# absolute or relative path from recipe file
patches: [path]
```

### Git source

```yaml
# URL to the git repository or path to local git repository
git_url: url | path
# revision to checkout to (commit or tag)
git_rev: string
git_depth: signed integer (defaults to -1 -> not shallow)
```

### Removed source definitions

SVN and HG (mercury) source definitions are removed as they are not relevant anymore.

## Requirements section

```yaml
requirements:
  # build time dependencies, in the build_platform architecture
  build: [MatchSpec]
  # dependencies to link against, in the target_platform architecture
  host: [MatchSpec]
  # the section below is copied into the index.json and required at package installation
  run: [MatchSpec]
  # constrain optional packages
  run_constrained: [MatchSpec]
```

## Test section

<details>
  <summary>
  The current state of the Test section.

Note: the test section also has a weird implicit behavior with `run_test.sh`, `run_test.bat` as well as `run_test.py` and `run_test.pl` script files
that are run as part of the test.

  </summary>
  ```yaml
  test:
    # files (from recipe directory) to include with the tests
    files: [glob]
    # files (from the work directory) to include with the tests
    source_files: [glob]
    # requirements at test time, in the target_platform architecture
    requires: [MatchSpec]
    # commands to execute
    commands: [string]
    # imports to execute with python (e.g. `import <string>`)
    imports: [string]
    # downstream packages that should be tested against this package
    downstreams: [MatchSpec]
  ```
</details>

```
test: [TestElement]
```

The new test section consists of a list of test elements. Each element is executed independently and can have different requirements. There are multiple types of test elements defined, such as the `command` test element, the `python` test element and the `downstream` test element.

#### Command test element

```yaml
# script to execute
script: string | [string]
# optional extra requirements
extra_requirements:
  # extra requirements with build_platform architecture (emulators, ...)
  build: [MatchSpec]
  # extra run dependencies
  run: [MatchSpec]
# extra files to add to the package for the test
# Alternatively, use ${{ RECIPE_DIR }} or ${{ SOURCE_DIR }} and a single list?
# or $RECIPE_DIR / $SRC_DIR ...
files:
  # files from $SRC_DIR
  source: [glob]
  # files from $RECIPE_DIR
  recipe: [glob]
```

#### Python test element

```yaml
python:
  # list of imports to try
  imports: [string]
```

#### Downstream test element

```yaml
downstream: MatchSpec
```

## Outputs section

conda-build has very hard to understand behavior with multiple outputs. We propose some drastic simplifications.
Each output in the new format has the same keys as a "top-level" recipe.

Values from the top-level `build`, `source` and `about` sections are (deeply) merged into each of the outputs.

The top-level package field is replaced by a top-level `recipe` field. The `version` from the top-level
`recipe` is also merged into each output. The top-level name is ignored (but could be used, e.g. for
the feedstock-name in the conda-forge case).

```yaml
# note: instead of `package`, it says `recipe` here
recipe:
  name: string # mostly ignored, could be used for feedstock name
  version: string # merged into each output if not overwritten by output

outputs:
  - package:
      name: string
      version: string (defaults to top-level version)
    build:
      # this package can only be used by other _outputs_ as build cache (for split packages)
      # in that way it replaces the top-level build
      # alternative names: package: true/false, output_package: true/false
      cache_only: bool (defaults to false)
      # cache from refers to the output from which the cache should be expanded into the WORK DIR
      cache_from: string | [string]
      # everything the same as top level
      script: ...
    requirements:
      # same definition as top level

    # as top level, by default merged from outer recipe
    about:
    source:
    test:
```

A cache only package does only package the `$WORK_DIR` (similar to how top-level packages work today) and each output that depends on a cache package via `cache_from`
will get a prepared `$WORK_DIR` with the build artifacts from the previously executed package.

> **Note**
> Should run-dependencies from the cache_only package be inherited? That would make `run_exports` work better ...

### Aside: variant computation for multiple outputs

Multiple outputs are treated like individual recipes after the merging of the nodes is completed.
Therefore, each variant is computed for each output individually.

Another tricky bit is that packages can be "strongly" connected with a `pin_subpackage(name, exact=True)` constraint.
In this case, the pinned package should also be part of the "variant configuration" for the output and appropriately zipped.

For example, we can have three outputs: libmamba, libmambapy, and mamba.

libmamba -> creates a single variant as it is a low-level C++ library
libmambapy -> creates multiple packages, one per python version
mamba -> creates multiple packages (one per python + libmambapy version)

This has historically been an issue in conda-build, as it didn't take into account `pin_subpackage` edges as "variants" and
sometimes created the same hashes for two different outputs.

## About section
