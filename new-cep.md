## Abstract

In order to support a variety use cases and extensions to conda's default
behavior, we propose a set of generic plugin hooks in this CEP. Included will be pre-run and post-run hooks that will allow
authors to execute their plugin code before or after conda commands
run, respectively. We outline several example cases in this CEP and
show exactly how plugin authors will define these new hooks.
