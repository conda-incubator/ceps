## Abstract

We propose a new recipe format that is heavily inspired by conda-build. The main change is a pure YAML format without arbitrary Jinja or comments with semantic meaning.

## Motivation

The conda-build format has grown over the years to become quite complex. Unfortunately it has never been formally "specified" and it has grown some features over time that make it hard to parse as straightforward YAML.

The CEP attempts to introduce a subset of the conda build format that allows for fast parsing and building of recipes.

### History

A discussion was started on what a new recipe spec could or should look like. The fragments of this discussion can be found here: https://github.com/mamba-org/conda-specs/blob/master/proposed_specs/recipe.md
The reason for a new spec are:

- Make it easier to parse ("pure yaml"). conda-build uses a mix of comments and jinja to achieve a great deal of flexibility, but it's hard to parse the recipe with a computer
- iron out some inconsistencies around multiple outputs (build vs. build/script and more)
- remove any need for recursive parsing & solving

## Major differences with conda-build

- no full Jinja2 support: no conditional or `{% set ...` support, only string interpolation. Variables can be set in the toplevel "context" which is valid YAML
- Jinja string interpolation needs to be quoted at the beginning of a string, e.g. `- "{{ version }}"` in order for it to be valid YAML
- Selectors use a YAML dictionary style (vs. comments in conda-build). E.g. `- sel(osx): somepkg` instead of `- somepkg  # [osx]`

## Selectors

Selectors in the new spec take the following format:

`sel(unix): selected_value`

This is a valid YAML dictionary. Selector contents are simple boolean expressions and follow Python syntax. The following selectors are all valid:

```
win and arm64
(osx or linux) and aarch64
something == "test"
```

### The cmp function for variant selection

Furthermore, we have a special "cmp" function that can be used to run a check against a selected variant version. The `cmp` function looks like the following:

```
cmp(python, "3.6")
cmp(python, ">=3.6")
cmp(python, ">=3.8,<3.10")
etc
```

This can be used in a selector like so:

```
requirements:
  build:
    - sel(cmp(python, ">=3.6,<3.10")): dataclasses
```

This functionality generalizes and replaces the previous special variables such as `py2k`, `py3k`, `py36`, `py37`, and works just as well for NumPy, Ruby, R, or any other variant that might be of interest in the future.

### Preprocessing selectors

You can add selectors to any item, and the selector is evaluated in
a preprocessing stage. If a selector evaluates to `true`, the item is
flattened into the parent element. If a selector evaluates to `false`,
the item is removed.

```yaml
source:
  - sel(not win):
      url: http://path/to/unix/source
  - sel(win):
      url: http://path/to/windows/source
```

Because the selector is a valid Jinja expression, complicated logic
is possible:

```yaml
source:
  - sel(win):
      url: http://path/to/windows/source
  - sel(unix and cmp(python, "2")):
      url: http://path/to/python2/unix/source
  - sel(unix and cmp(python, "3")):
      url: http://path/to/python3/unix/source
```

Lists are automatically "merged" upwards, so it is possible to group multiple items under a single selector:

```yaml
test:
  commands:
    - sel(unix):
      - test -d ${PREFIX}/include/xtensor
      - test -f ${PREFIX}/include/xtensor/xarray.hpp
      - test -f ${PREFIX}/lib/cmake/xtensor/xtensorConfig.cmake
      - test -f ${PREFIX}/lib/cmake/xtensor/xtensorConfigVersion.cmake
    - sel(win):
      - if not exist %LIBRARY_PREFIX%\include\xtensor\xarray.hpp (exit 1)
      - if not exist %LIBRARY_PREFIX%\lib\cmake\xtensor\xtensorConfig.cmake (exit 1)
      - if not exist %LIBRARY_PREFIX%\lib\cmake\xtensor\xtensorConfigVersion.cmake (exit 1)

# On unix this is rendered to:
test:
  commands:
    - test -d ${PREFIX}/include/xtensor
    - test -f ${PREFIX}/include/xtensor/xarray.hpp
    - test -f ${PREFIX}/lib/cmake/xtensor/xtensorConfig.cmake
    - test -f ${PREFIX}/lib/cmake/xtensor/xtensorConfigVersion.cmake
```

## Templating with Jinja

The spec supports simple Jinja templating in the `recipe.yaml` file.

You can set up Jinja variables in the context YAML section:

```yaml
context:
  name: "test"
  version: "5.1.2"
  major_version: "{{ version.split('.')[0] }}"
```

Later in your `recipe.yaml` you can use these values in string interpolation
with Jinja. For example:

```yaml
source:
  url: https://github.com/mamba-org/{{ name }}/v{{ version }}.tar.gz
```

Jinja has built-in support for some common string manipulations.

In the new spec, complex Jinja is completely disallowed as we try to produce YAML that is valid at all times.
So you should not use any `{% if ... %}` or similar Jinja constructs that produce invalid yaml.
Furthermore, quotes need to be applied when starting a value with double-curly brackets like so:

```yaml
package:
  name: {{ name }}   # WRONG: invalid yaml
  name: "{{ name }}" # correct
```

Some Jinja functions remain valid, but this is out of the scope of this spec. However, as an example, 
the `compiler` Jinja function will still be available, with the main difference being the quoting of the
brackets.

```yaml
requirements:
  build:
    - "{{ compiler('cxx') }}"
```
